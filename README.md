The React Native Coffee Shop App serves as the front-end interface for customers to interact with the AI-powered chatbot and explore the menu. Designed with a clean, intuitive user experience in mind, the app seamlessly integrates the chatbot for real-time customer service, enabling users to place orders, receive personalized product recommendations, and get detailed information about menu items.

### Key Features:
* **Landing Page:** A welcoming entry point to the coffee shop experience.
* **Home Page:** Displays featured menu items and product categories.
* **Item Details Page:** Provides detailed descriptions, including ingredients and allergens for each item.
* **Cart Page:** Allows users to review and modify their order before checkout.
* **Chatbot Interface:** Enables customers to interact directly with the AI chatbot for order assistance, recommendations, and queries.



1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash

   ```
   If you are using WSL like me then make sure your project is in the /home directory and run the command above like so.
   ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
